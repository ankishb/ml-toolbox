Closure

There are a lot of usecases for something like this. It's especially useful for when you want to add or alter the 
functionality of your functions, without altering the code of the functions themselves. So for example, in this 
video I added logging capabilities to the add and subtract functions, all without adding any logging code to those 
functions themselves. This allows us to keep all of the logic separated into their own specific functions. If #you'd 
like to read more about it, I would suggest looking up "Aspect Oriented Programming". You will see a few more useful 
examples there. And that only touches on a couple of reasons why something like this would be useful. If #you've ever 
used a framework, like the Flask web framework for Python, then you'll notice that they have decorators all over their 
code. Those decorators are essentially closures that allow us to add routing and error handling capabilities to our 
functions. So you'll definitely find a usecase for something like this in the future. If you don't use it yourself, 
then you'll most likely run across someone else using it. So it's good to know.ï»¿
