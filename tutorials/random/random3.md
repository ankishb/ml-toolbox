        Question 1. In Tensorflow, What Exactly Bias And Variance Are? Do You Find Any Similarity Of Difference Between Them?

        Answer :

        In the learning algorithms, Bias are generally considered as errors that declare their presence due to overly assumptions. These can sometimes result in failure of entire model and can largely affect the accuracy also in several cases. Some experts believe these errors are essential to enable learners gain knowledge from a training point of view. On the other side, Variance is another problem that comes when the learning algorithm is quite complex. Therefore a limit is to be imposed on this.

        Question 2. When Will You Find Overfit Condition Of Your Model In Tensorflow?

        Answer :

        There are variations in the training data or data that needs to be verified through TensorFlow. If the variations are very large in the data, probably it could lead to this problem. The best possible solution is to remove the noise from the available data upto the possible extent.

        Question 4. Are You Familiar With A Fourier Transform?

        Answer :

        Well, it is a mathematical concept. Basically, it is a generic method that is used for decomposing the generic functions into a superposition of other functions that are generally symmetric in nature. When it comes to finding the speeds of cycles and amplitudes, they are widely adopted in the machine learning. Fourier Transformation is also used for solving some of the very complex problems of mathematics.

        Answer :

        The other name of Recall is true positive rate. Actually, it is the overall figure of positiveness a model generally claim. Precision is generally regarded as the predictive value which is positive in nature. The difference between the true positive rate an claimed positive rate can be defined with the help of both these options.

        Question 10. In The Machine Learning Context, How Useful And Reliable Bayes’ Theorem Is According To You?

        Answer :

        This theorem defines the probability of any event in machine learning. It represents a fixed value which is actually a mathematical calculation. This value is generally obtained by dividing the true positive rate divided by the false positive rate. In machine learning, some of the very complex problems and challenges can easily be solved and eliminated with the help of this theorem. Most of the time results provided by it are highly accurate and can easily be trusted.

        Question 11. What Difference Do You Find In Type I And Type Ii Errors?

        Answer :

        Type I error is a false positive value. On the other side, Type II error is a false negative value. Type I error generally represent that something has happened when actually it doesn’t while Type II error is to representing the machine that nothing is wrong when actually something is not good.

        Question 12. In Tensorflow, What Exactly Discriminative And Generative Method?

        Answer :

        All the distinction among the different types of data can simply be learned with the help of discriminative method. On the other side, generative model is used for understanding a specific format of same. The tasks that can also be handled with both these approaches need to be classified in a well-defined order first.

        Question 13. What Exactly Do You Mean By Pruning In A Decision Tree?

        Answer :

        Many times it has been seen that in a cluster the predictive powers are very weak and they need to be removed. This is to cut down the overall complexity of the model or to increase the accuracy. This condition is generally considered as Pruning. There is a strict limit on pruning otherwise it makes the model totally useless. The latest version available in the machine learning algorithms is Reduced error pruning.

        Question 21. How Can You Make Sure That Overfitting Situation Is Not Arriving With A Model You Are Using?

        Answer :

        Users need to make sure that their model is simple and is not having any complex statement. All the variance should be taken into the account and the noise should be eliminated from the model data. Cross-validation technique like k-fold is another useful method that is helpful in this matter. LASSO technique is another possible solution to this issue.

        Question 22. In Which Situation The Ensemble Approach Is Useful?

        Answer :

        In a model, there is a need to use multiple learning algorithms. This situation needs ensemble approach. In addition to this, there can also be a need to combine an applied part of learning algorithms for the optimization or the predictive performance. One of the primary aim to use this approach is to impose a limit on the overfitting. 

        Question 23. On A Time Series Dataset, What Type Of Validation Technique Would You Prefer?

        Answer :

        This dataset is not a randomly distributed data and thus the standard techniques such as k-folds cannot be applied. Therefore a pattern based technique would be useful here and this is because it makes sure that all the sub-tasks flow in a well-defined sequence. There are no chances of any errors that can be considered as a chronological order that creates issues related to the functionality of the model.
