Music
While music streaming brands have come up with innovative value added services like voice assistant, automated one-touch personalised playlists, song mixing, and more, the real power of AI lies beyond such features. Extensive research is currently being carried out on the potential of using state-of-the-art AI to analyse music, not just using metadata, but by analysing the actual song itself, so as to gain a deeper understanding of the melodic medium. This presents an incredibly boundless prospect for its application in the music industry, and the domain, as a whole.



Personalised music recommendations have not only been a boon for consumers, but for artists as well. Serving as a platform for countless budding musicians to showcase their work and present it to the world, it allows many musicians to have a direct audience, even before becoming a breakout star with mass acclaim. As a result, users have often discovered talented musicians on streaming platforms, who have later gone on to win critical acclaim, signifying the creation of a symbiotic avenue for growth in the industry, both for the services and the artists.








However, unlike Spotify, Apple Music offers only one AI-based service called Genius Playlist, in which the user selects a song they like, then the algorithm generates an instant playlist with songs that might be related to it, after analyzing previously listened to playlists, likes, dislikes and skipped songs.







How many times have you remembered part of the lyrics of a song, but not the exact title? Why take your smartphone and type the lyrics on Google when it's easier to say "Alexa, let me listen to the song that goes "..." and quote the lyrics that you remember, hopefully accurately. Fans of classical and techno music may be a little frustrated in this case though. 








The application can take into account factors such as location, time of day and weather to suggest the right tracks from the catalog of over 30 million songs. Would you like to enjoy a Saturday night at home? It will recommend a cheerful and energetic playlist of the best pop hits. Just got home from work? It will suggest a variety of softer songs.




As the user listens, the recommendations get better due to their machine learning smarts. This is collected in a playlist called ‘Your Mixtape’ which is updated every day. Apart from that, the app has multiple subcategories on the homepage.

According to the time of day, the app recommends specific music that is listened to at that time. It also harvests location data occasionally to recommend music, such as for home, gym or work.



The song radio function on YouTube is functional at best and does not perform the role of showing new music to the user. It plays one or two songs that are similar to the subject of the song radio  but continues to pick songs out of users’ libraries after that, leading to a stagnant listening experience.

	Now based on user's feature and genre, we can recommend songs and album

	Two advantage:
		1. Getting feedback
		2. User will be excited and may recommend to other friend this way

Marketing using ML
1. find the right customer
2. segmentization using graph, which narrows down the area to focus
3. personalized experience of custom also helps to recommend the more likable service to user

1) AI uses large arrays of data to identify valuable patterns

2) ML helps create more advanced customer interactions
Microsoft is one such company that is using ML to develop a multi-sensory experience that examines customers’ sight, sound, touch, gestures and even gaze in order to have full-fledged interactions with them that mimic the real thing.

## Introduction:

** This is how I figured this out after being rejected by 3 interviews **

This is the question I myself googled 100 times when I was about to give an interview. After having an experience of about 5–6 good as well as bad interviews, well-research, and keen-observation I came up with this solution which will definitely help you to create the best FIRST IMPRESSION of yourself in the eyes of the interviewer.

Most of my interviews started with this question

Interviewer: “Ok Rahul! tell me about yourself”.

I used to practice this common yet important interview question by preparing the answer in my mind and each time I get confused on the following points:

    What are the necessary topics that I must include
    Which point to tell first
    How to present this achievement
    What will be the best order of topics

So, I decided to overcome these confusions and finally came up with this template, which literally helped me a lot to ace the interview.

The template will make you powerful enough to take control of the interview in your hand and you will be able to mold the interview in the direction you want.

5 point template is as follows(maintain the same order for a good result):

1. Resume Walk Through

    Headline
        Beginning of Career
        Go through forward(chronologically)

This should be quick enough.

✔ Example- Hello, I am Rahul, pre-final year undergrad at IIITDM Jabalpur, majoring in CSE with current CPI of 8.20. I had a chance to gain experience from one internship and a few academic as well as non-academic projects.

2. Quick shows of Success

✔ Example- I used to participate in a lot of hackathons and managed to win two national-level hackathons organized by IBM and HackerEarth.

3. Key Stories

Just hint, let the interviewer ask for details.

✔ Example- I also have past experience of working as a Freelancer, Coordinator of FilmMaking Club, which all helped me to develop my communication as well as management skills.

4. Hobbies

    Technical: Programming, Development, Marketing, Blogging, Designing, Editing, etc
    Non-Technical: try to make them relevant(showing personality skills, hard work, teamwork, etc.)

✔ Example- In spare time, I love to write blogs, design(UI) websites and play Table Tennis.

5. Projects(at least 2–3 projects)

This is the most crucial section because at this point you will make the interviewer to ask questions. So tell only those projects which you are most confident about.

✔ Example- I spent this past winter in New Delhi, working as an intern in a product based company. There, I worked on the chatbot project. It was a great experience overall and I learned a lot about Cloud Technologies, NLP, Github, and TeamWork.

This will give the interviewer a hint, and he/she will ask you to explain the project in detail.

Start explaining the project in this order

    Goal
    Team
    Technologies
    Architecture
    Your Role

To explain your role better follow this STAR principle:

    Situation
    Task
    Action
    Result

✔ Example- I worked a lot in developing the backend of the chatbot. After the chatbot went through the formal testing, My team was happy with the outputs but something is bothering us. The chatbot was not engaging enough from the user’s perspective. So, after a lot of brainstorming, I took the job of integrating the chatbot with Google Assistant. Within 4 days, the chatbot is working flawlessly on Google Assistant with the amazing user experience.

NOTE: Focus on your accomplishments, rather than bragging about the team. Avoid using words like we, us more frequently.

The overall intro will sound like this:

I can assure you that if I get this opportunity, my skills and experience will add real value to the company.

Last but not least, always wear this kind of smile☻

I can assure you that preparing this question with the template provided will give you optimal confidence to ace any interview
