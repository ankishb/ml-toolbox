Originally Answered: How do I prepare for a data scientist interview at WalmartLabs ?

Usually data science type of interviews want to judge if you have enough skills in SQL, R, Python, Machine learning, optimization, and/or more programming techniques such as Monte Carlo Simulations, modeling in general and how best you would approach a problem ~ that is how well you think.

The better your thinking, the better your model. The better and easier your model, the easier it is to set it up, and solve it.

I am now going to ask you questions that I would ask someone if they were to interview with me. My views do not reflect the views of the place where I work, and I do not want to add any bias of places I have worked at before. An interview with respect to the place I work at will be completely different, but might* overlap a little with the questions I ask in the below.

Now, straight to the questions:

Just identifying problems:

    To give you an idea about a data scientist’s role, usually one has to first identify a problem. Tell me how you would go after identifying a problem?
    How would you calibrate that the problem you have identified is one of the most important problems to solve?
    How will you propose a solution to this kind of problem?
    How would you find out what are the top ten money draining projects that the State of Wisconsin has launched in last 5 years?
    A more specific question: Imagine you are working for a giant hospital that operates in multiple cities. You have a week to take a look at all the data available that the hospital has collected. The data are available in SQL servers and elaborate SQL queries can be written. How would you go after proposing to the managing director on what to focus on?
    I have LinkedIn data available for a geography ~ Say Seattle. Anyone outside of this Geography has been filtered out. Now with remaining 4 million people, I want to find out how connected this network is. How will you formulate this problem?
    Lets say you work for Walmart Labs. Walmart wants to identify which geographies are not doing very well and would like to identify a few things it can do to improve the sales. How will you identify which geographies are not doing well?
        How will you rank them?
        How will you drill this down to the level of ZIP codes?
        How will you identify profitable ZIP codes vs loss making ZIP codes?
        How will you identify if this problem is getting worse over time?
    Walmart has a standard floor design. How will you make it better for future stores?
        How will you propose changes to the existing floor plan of Walmart?
        How will you rank 50 such changes?
        How will you test them?
        How will you setup a pilot to test this, and then improve based off the pilot?
    Imagine that Walmart has X thousand cashiers working for all stores in US. We want to launch self check out lanes, and also want to hire cashier associates. How will you find out where an optimum point exists for a particular store. How will you scale this to the entire US network?
    We have demographic data available for every state, ZIP code. We have sales numbers available for all states, but not ZIP codes. How will you figure out approximate sales figures for each ZIP code?
    Now that you have figured out that some of the ZIP codes are most profitable. You have to propose the next best locations of 10 Walmart stores. How will you identify these locations?

SQL type of questions:

I want to calculate mean, standard deviation, count, of a metric. Then for each item in the list I want to calculate how much percentage deviation occurs with respect to the mean. Write a simple SQL program that achieve this. I can setup a very simple table to do this, and then ask how someone is approaching this.

Python, R, Machine learning etc:

    How would you go after identifying which machine learning algorithm works the best for a model problem?
    I have a set of data collected over last one year. With knn clustering algorithm I want to identify the top 100 clusters and filter out all the remaining clusters. How will you achieve this? What hurdles will you get into? (This is so open ended that when a candidate begins answering one can drill down on what they are thinking and how they are approaching the problem)
    How does random forest algorithm work?
    Lets say I have data representative of house prices. There are 80 variables that define a house’s price. I want to predict the prices of 1000 houses based off the available data from 2000 houses. How will you come up with a model? And which algorithms can be used?
    Explain how ‘one-hot-encoding works’.
    Explain how linear regression can be made better?

Check out this one on modeling. I would certainly prepare these and model https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/...

Integer programming type of problems:

    I have three variables that can take values between 0 and 1. They are given in three columns. They are multiplied by X, and then sum of that multiplication is subtracted from Y given in another column called Col_Sum.
        The sum of the variables must be less than equal to 2 for each row.
        The sum of the Col_Sum must be maximized.
        How will you formulate this problem and how will you solve this?

Monte Carlo type of problems:

    How will you write a Monte Carlo type of solver for traveling salesman problem?

Math and scientific computing, probability etc:

    Explain how Fourier transforms work?
    How does Naive Bayes algorithm work?

Hope some of these pointers help the people wanting to prepare for interviews like these. Usually the time available in an interview is very little, but as soon as an interview takes a direction, it is easy enough to continue to dive deeper and deeper all the way to the point that one can be slicing and dicing an algorithm.

    One general advice is that you should try to explain things in simple words, with simpler models, and simpler techniques. Simplicity is always preferred, and your interview will certainly have a smoother sail.
    If should be able to draw things on charts quickly, so you should practice this.
    Statistics is foundation of data-science, and whether people know machine learning or not, they know statistics far better, so testing that knowledge is easier even for non-programmers.
    You should be able to tell stories on how you solved problems in your previous jobs, because almost 60–80 percent of the interview can simply focus on it.
    That being said, you should certainly review ton of other questions I have posted about Data-Science, Python, Machine learning and so on.

What are some uses of machine learning in search engines?
4 Answers
Nikhil Dandekar
Nikhil Dandekar, worked on machine learning at Microsoft, Foursquare and Quora
Answered Mar 22, 2016

Machine learning is used in almost every part of the system at major search engines like Google or Bing. Anything that requires some sort of "intelligence" is often solved using machine learning.

Here are some places machine learning is used in search engines:

    Search ranking: Often search engines have multiple phases of ranking that happen in series, such as initial retrieval, primary ranking, contextual ranking, personalized ranking etc. Machine learning is used for ranking at all these phases, often using Learning to Rank systems.
    Query understanding: Machine Learning is used for almost everything that's done to understand the search query typed by the user. Some examples of this:
        Query classification: Search engines run various different classifiers on the search query . E.g. Detecting navigational vs. informational vs. transactional queries. Or news queries vs. local intent queries vs. shopping queries etc.
        Spelling suggestion / correction
        Synonyms / Query expansion: Search engines use synonyms to expand the query keywords and expand the result set.
        Intent disambiguation: E.g. when you search for [eagles], is it Eagles the band or Philadelphia Eagles or the bird (or all 3)?
        Various other facets that you can interpret a query by
    Url / document understanding: This includes everything that is done to understand a url, i.e. a search result. This is often done when the search engine crawls/indexes the url. Some examples of this:
        Page classification: Understanding what types of a page it is. E.g. blog vs. news site vs. forum etc.
        Spam detection
        Junk / low-quality url detection
        Sentiment analysis
        Entity / relationship detection: Detecting entities, such as people or places in the page content. Figuring out relationships between entities.
        ...and various other facets you can interpret a url by
    Generating other content that search engines display such as:
        Sitelinks
        Related searches
        Knowledge graph data (for some search engines)
    Crawlers use machine learning to figure out the optimal rate to crawl a particular url based on it's importance, how often it is updated etc.
    User classification: Figuring out what kind of an user you are. This is especially useful for personalized search

This is just scratching the surface. At places like Google and Bing, with hundreds of people working on machine learning, the actual list is much longer

























Will you be...

    Designing and interpreting experiments to test variants of the product? Expect some questions regarding A/B testing, questions regarding which metrics would be best to optimize, and questions about how to best evaluate your experimental results.
    Doing deep dives to understand more about how users use your product? Expect questions that test your ability to carry an data project from end-to-end, and to effectively and faithfully communicate your findings. Expect to discuss projects from previous experiences or your education and communicate what you were able to find and what you did.
    Developing features for a data product? For example Uber's Surge Pricing feature or LinkedIn's People You May Know feature. Depending on your specific role, you may be getting a traditional software engineering interview with a focus on processing large amounts of data, or be asked about your previous experience with solving large-scale, difficult, and custom data problems.

Of course there are many more roles of a data scientist - so do your research on both the product and the role before you set foot in the interview room.

Ultimately the key question you should be asking yourself is - within my role at the company, what is the best way to best understand and improve the product and the business using data?

Tinker around with the product:

If you can use the product, use it as much as possible before the interview. One type of data scientist is heavily involved in the process of making decisions to help improve the product and the features - and to understand the product quantitatively as much as possible.

Let your curiosity run free, and answer questions like - how can this product be improved? What kind of metrics would you define to measure its success? How could this product monetize? How could this product make more money? How would you define engagement on this product? What could be some friction points? What are the key funnels or actions that you want your users to go through? Show that you understand the system that as a data scientist you're going to be working to improve.

Familiarize yourself with the product, as it's very easy to reveal your lack of preparation if you don't have basic knowledge of the product you may be working on. Also, interviewers will likely ask you data-related questions about the projects they are working on.

Think of ways on how to improve the product:

After playing around with the product as much as you can - ask yourself the following questions:

    What are aspects of the product that you really enjoy? What are your favorite features? Why do you think those features exist?
    What are aspects of the product that you don't enjoy? Why don't you enjoy them? Why might the product even have such a feature if there are people that don't enjoy it?
    If you could suggest some new features for the product, what would you recommend? Is this something that is aimed at increasing growth, engagement, revenue, or brand value? Do you think that your recommended features would be high-ROI?
    What are ways in which the company could use data to help improve the product, that it doesn't seem to be doing already?

These questions will get you in the shoes of thinking about the product and various tradeoffs that are done in making product decisions. This gets you in the right mindset to answer some of the questions that you might get about the product and what the data scientists are working on in helping make it the best it can be.

After playing around with the product, think about this: what are some of the key metrics that the product might want to optimize? Part of a data scientist's role in certain companies involve working closely with the product teams to help define, measure, and report on these metrics. This is an exercise you can go through by yourself at home, and can really help during your interview process
